**SR23 ADS&AA Lab Sheet**

Construct an AVL tree for a given set of elements which are stored in a file. And implement insert and delete operation on the constructed tree. Write contents of tree into a new file using in-order.
Construct B-Tree an order of 5 with a set of 100 random elements stored in array. Implement searching, insertion and deletion operations. 
Construct Min and Max Heap using arrays, delete any element and display the content of the Heap. 
Implement BFT and DFT for given graph, when graph is represented by a) Adjacency Matrix b) Adjacency Lists 
Write a program for finding the bi-connected components in a given graph. 
Implement Quick sort and Merge sort and observe the execution time for various input sizes (Average, Worst and Best cases).
